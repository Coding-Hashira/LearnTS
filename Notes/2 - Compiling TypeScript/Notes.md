# Compiling TypeScript

- Browsers can't understand TypeScript!
  When you'll write code in a TypeScript file, it'll not get applied to HTML file directly as browsers can't understand TypeScript.
  But then, how will you use TypeScript? ðŸ¤”
- Compiling TypeScript to JavaScript
  Well, the answer is: You've to compile TS into JS. Let's see how you can do it!

## Compiling TS into JS

- Well, compiling TS is a very simple.
- Create a file named `sandbox.ts` in your root directory.
- Write the code you want to compile.
- Run this command in terminal `tsc sandbox.ts sandbox.js`
- BOOM! Done! You've successfully compiled TS into JS!! ðŸŽŠðŸŽŠ

## Compiling TS in watch mode

- Do you know you've to run this command everytime you make a change in your TS file! ðŸ¤¯
- Quite overwhelming, isn't it?
- Here's the solution: Watch mode!
- Now, run this command in terminal: `tsc sandbox.ts -w`
- This `-w` stands for watch mode and it compiles your sandbox file in watch mode.
- This means that TS is watching your file, and will automatically re-compile it whenever you'll make a change!
- Cool, right? ðŸ˜Ž
